\title{surveyzones: Workload-Balanced Zone Construction for Survey Field Operations}
\description{
Constructs compact, workload-balanced geographic zones for survey field teams. Given a set of census tracts with access points and expected service times, the package computes sparse pairwise distances (using pluggable distance engines), solves a capacitated p-median problem via mixed-integer linear programming to assign tracts to zones, and sequences visits within each zone. Supports partitioning by jurisdiction and parameter sweeps for scenario comparison.
